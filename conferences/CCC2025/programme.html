				<h5><a href="https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/ad260">Anuj Dawar</a> <em>Lower Bounds for Symmetric Algebraic Circuits</em></h5>
					<p>Algebraic circuits (also known as arithmetic circuits) are a model for
computing polynomial functions over an arbtrary field.  Valiant's
conjecture that VP is different from VNP is sometimes called an
algebraic analogue of the conjecture that P is different from NP and has
been an open question for nearly as long.  It amounts to showing that
algebraic circuits for computing the permanent of a matrix are
necessarily of super-polynomial size.  We are able to show lower bounds
on circuits computing the permanent when restricted to certain symmetry
conditions.  With a natural notion of symmetry, this gives an
exponential separation between the size of circuits computing the
permanent and those computing the determinant.  The result is sensitive
to the choice of symmetries considered.</br>

In this talk, I give a general introduction to algebraic circuits and
Valiant's conjecture.  I explain and motivate the symmetry restrictions
and explore the lower bounds that can be established.  I also give an
overview of the proof methods, which bring together combinatorial
techniques with methods from finite model theory.</p>

 					<p>The talk first introduces the history and background of types for communications and multiparty session types, relating to the history of Computer Science in Oxford.</br>
						Multiparty session types (MPST) are a type discipline for enforcing the structured, deadlock-free communication of concurrent and message-passing programs. Traditional MPST have a limited form of choice in which alternative communication possibilities are offered by a single participant and selected by another. Mixed choice multiparty session types (MCMP) extend the choice construct to include both selections and offers in the same choice. This talk presents a mixed choice synchronous multiparty session calculus and its typing system, which guarantees communication safety and deadlock-freedom. We then talk expressiveness of nine subcalcli of MCMP-calculus by examining their encodability (there exists a good encoding from one to another) and separation (there exists no good encoding from one calculus to another). The highlight is the binary (2-party) mixed sessions by Casal et al (2022) is strictly less expressive than the MCMP-calculus.</br>

She is an EPSRC Established Career Fellow and an Honorary Fellow at Glasgow University. Last 10 years, her main research interests are theories and applications of protocols specifications and verifications. She introduced multiparty session types [POPL’08, JACM] which received Most Influential POPL Paper Award in 2018 (judged by its influence over the last decade). This work enlarged the community and widened the scope of applications of session types, e.g. runtime monitoring based on Scribble (co-developed with Red Hat) has been deployed to other projects such as cyberinfrastructure in the US Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI); and widened the scope of her research areas. She received the Test-of-time-award from PPDP'24 and the best paper awards from CC'20, COORDINATION'23, DisCoTech'23 and ECOOP’23.

				<h5><a href="https://www.uni-siegen.de/fb6/tcs/team/spreen/">Dieter Spreen</a> <em>Computing with Compact Sets</em></h5>
					<p>In collaboration with U. Berger, a general framework was presented for extracting algorithms that compute on elements of compact metric spaces and their compact subsets from proofs in a many-sorted intuitionistic first-order predicate logic, extended by strictly positive inductive and coinductive definitions. The approach is computationally equivalent to Weihrauch's type-two theory of effectivity. Unlike this approach, however, it is purely logical and representation-free. Representations of the computed objects are obtained via a realizability interpretation of the logic. Note that although the logic is fundamentally intuitionistic, much of classical logic is nevertheless available: any genuine disjunction-free formula can be used as an axiom.</br>
				In this talk, we discuss the mathematical framework introduced for the treatment of elements and nonempty compact subsets of compact metric spaces in formal logic. Furthermore, we present a generalization of Berger's nested coinductive inductive characterization of uniformly continuous functions of the unit interval to the general case of compact metric spaces. This characterization enables the treatment of (constructively) uniformly continuous functions in the aforementioned first-order logical calculus and the derivation of programs for computing such functions. We re-prove some well-known results in metric space theory based on the characterization. The proofs now use coinduction and induction in a nested manner and differ significantly from the usual proofs of classical topology.</p>
