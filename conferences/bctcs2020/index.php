<p>The <a href="http://www.bctcs.ac.uk/">British Colloquium for Theoretical
Computer Science (BCTCS)</a> is an annual event for UK-based researchers in
theoretical computer science. A central aspect of BCTCS is the training of PhD
students, providing an environment for students to gain experience in
presenting their work, to broaden their outlook on the subject, and to benefit
from contact with established researchers. The scope of the colloquium includes
all aspects of theoretical computer science, including automata theory,
algorithms, complexity theory, semantics, formal methods, concurrency, types,
languages and logics.</p>

      <p>BCTCS 2020 is the 36<sup>th</sup> conference in the series and is being held together with a workshop organized by AlgoUK, a network for the UK's algorithms and complexity research community.</p>
