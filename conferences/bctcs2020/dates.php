	<p>We have a number of <strong>bursaries</strong> which can be used to reimburse the travel and accommodation expenses of UK-based PhD students. We hope to be able to offer these to all PhD students who provide a talk; but in the case of over-subscription, they will be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. Please contact the organisers for more details.</p>
