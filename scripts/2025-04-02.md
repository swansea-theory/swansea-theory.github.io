<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Today Eike Neumann will give a talk on Threshold Problems for Orbits of Semigroup Actions as a part of our theory seminar series.</span></div><div class="elementToProof" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="elementToProof" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><b>Abstract:</b></span></div><div class="elementToProof" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Consider the following computational problem: Given a real function g on a space X, a compactly generated semi-group S acting on X, and a point x in X, is g positive on every point of the orbit of x under S?</span></div><div class="elementToProof" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="elementToProof" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">This generalises a large number of widely studied problems, such as safety and liveness verification for discrete-time dynamical systems (corresponding to semi-groups with a single generator), threshold problems for stochastic (corresponding stochastic matrices acting on probability distributions) or quantum automata (corresponding to unitary operators acting on Hilbert spaces) and more.</span></div><div class="elementToProof" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="elementToProof" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">When the objects above are presented via rational or algebraic data, the associated problems quickly become undecidable or very sensitive to the problem formulation. For example, threshold problems for stochastic automata are undecidable in general, and threshold problems for quantum automata are decidable if and only if they are formulated using strict inequality.</span></div><div class="elementToProof" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="elementToProof" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">I will consider the above problem in its general form from the computable analysis perspective, replacing decidability with maximal partial decidability. I will give a sound algorithm that partially decides the problem over effectively locally compact spaces. I will show that the algorithm is complete when the space is zero-dimensional or locally contractible, and give some examples of spaces where the algorithm is not complete but the problem is maximally partially decidable and spaces where the problem is not maximally partially decidable at all.</span></div><div><br /></div>
