<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><a href="https://t-powell.github.io/" target="_blank">Thomas Powell</a> and <a href="https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/davide-barbarossa" target="_blank">Davide Barbarossa</a>&nbsp;(Bath University) are visiting Swansea this week. This afternoon Thomas will give a talk on the "Rates of convergence for stochastic processes" as a part of our seminar series.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="elementToProof" style="margin: 0cm; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><b style="background-color: white; color: #222222;">Abstract:&nbsp;</b>I will present two ongoing projects in the new area of proof mining&nbsp;&nbsp;in stochastic optimization, each representing a distinct inroad into the area.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I will give an account of recent work with Morenikeji Neri that focuses&nbsp;on convergence proofs based on martingales: This quantitative study of&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: inherit;">martingale convergence has resulted in several variants of the famous&nbsp;&nbsp;Robbins-Siegmund theorem that come equipped with numerical information,&nbsp;with applications including stochastic quasi-Fejer monotone sequences&nbsp;and gradient-descent type algorithms. Second, I will report on some work in&nbsp;progress with Nicholas Pischkeon a new stochastic alternating Halpern-Mann&nbsp;scheme with noise terms: In addition to new convergence results (both&nbsp;qualitative and quantitative), this project has led to an interesting application&nbsp;in reinforcement learning, demonstrating that the techniques of proof mining&nbsp;are relevant for current research in the mathematics of artificial intelligence.</span></div><div class="elementToProof" style="direction: ltr; margin: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="elementToProof" style="direction: ltr; margin: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div class="elementToProof" style="direction: ltr; margin: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div><br /></div>
