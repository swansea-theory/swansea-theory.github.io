<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Next week <a href="https://research.ugent.be/web/person/giovanni-solda-0/publications/en" target="_blank">Giovanni Solda</a> is visiting us from Ghent. He will give a talk on "<span class="ContentPasted0">A combinatorial principle weak over weak systems yet strong over strong systems</span>".</span></span>

<i><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span class="ContentPasted1">Better quasi orders (henceforth bqos) are a strengthening of the notion of well quasi order. Even if their definition is more complicated, the former enjoy nice closure properties that make them, in a way, easier to work with than the latter: this feature made bqos an

instrumental tool in proving landmark results like Nash-Williams'

theorem and Laver's theorem. From the reverse mathematical point of

view, the study of bqos is an interesting area still full of open

questions.<br class="ContentPasted1" />In this talk, we will focus on a property of non-bqos, the so-called

minimal bad array lemma, and in particular one version of it that we

will call MBA − . We will show that MBA − has a very odd behavior when

it comes to its reverse-mathematical strength, namely

quasi-orders that ACA 0 proves to be bqos.</i></span></span>
