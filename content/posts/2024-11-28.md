<span style="font-family: inherit;">Next week's theory seminar will be given by <a href="https://profiles.sussex.ac.uk/p623544-matteo-acclavio" target="_blank">Matteo Acclavio</a> from the University of Sussex, who is visiting us for a few days. The topic will be a new logical framework for concurrent programs, abstract below.</span>

<span style="font-family: inherit;"><b>Title: </b>A new logical framework for concurrent programs<br /></span>

<span style="font-family: inherit;"><b>Abstract:</b><br />Designing logical frameworks to reason about the properties of concurrent programs while accurately capturing the essence of concurrency is a challenging task.<br />The main difficulties can be traced back to the syntactic constraints of the languages used for this purpose.</span>

<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">In this talk, I will present my ongoing line of research, which aims to provide a new computation-as-deduction paradigm for the study of concurrent programs.<br />In particular, I will show you a

non-commutative logic where we can interpret proofs as computation trees for the pi-calculus, and use proof nets to provide canonical representations of these trees modulo interleaving concurrency.<br /><br />This work is based on joint works with Giulia Manara and Fabrizio Montesi</span></div>
