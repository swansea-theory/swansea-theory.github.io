The Swansea Theory Group is internationally renowned for its research
 in Logic in Computer Science. The active research areas are: 
Computability Theory, Computational Complexity, Proof Theory, Type 
Theory, Game Theory, Algorithms,

Formal Methods (Automated and 
Interactive Theorem Proving), Cyber Security, Blockchain Technology, 
Verification of Railway Control Systems), Artificial Intelligence 
(Satisfiability Solving, Multi-agent Systems, Argumentation Theory, 
Trustable Machine Learning, AI and Law).


The research on Railway Control Systems has lead to the formation of the <a href="https://www.swansea.ac.uk/compsci/research-and-impact/swansea-railway-verification/">Swansea Railway Verification Group</a>

which also delivered

two Impact Case Studies.


Another recently formed subgroup studies the
