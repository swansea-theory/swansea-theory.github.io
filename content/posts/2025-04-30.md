Abstract:

Weihrauch problems can be regarded as containers over the category of projective represented spaces and Weihrauch reductions correspond exactly to container morphisms. Using this characterisation, a number of operators over Weihrauch degrees, including the pomposition of degrees, arise naturally from the theory of polynomial functors.
