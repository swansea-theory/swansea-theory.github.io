*Title*

Relative induction principles for the syntax of type theory

*Abstract*

The syntax and semantics of dependent type theories and other languages with variable binders can be presented in either a first-order or a higher-order way. Both perspectives are useful. The first-order presentation has well-behaved semantics, but the first-order encoding of the notions of variables, substitutions, etc. can be hard to work with. The higher-order presentations are easier to work with, but do not immediately come with an induction principle. I will present relative induction principles, which provide a way to perform induction over syntax without the bureaucracy of the first-order encoding.This is based on my recently defended PhD thesis "Relative induction principles for second-order generalized algebraic theories" (https://rafaelbocquet.gitlab.io/pdfs/thesis.pdf).
