In this week's theory seminar, we will host a talk by [Kevin
Buzzard](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/k.buzzard).

### Abstract

I am currently involved in a project to teach a computer proof
assistant a proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem. In this talk I’ll explain what a
computer proof assistant is, and I’ll try and explain something about the nature
of the task, how I ended up doing it, and why I think it’s interesting and
important. The talk will be suitable for both computer scientists and
mathematicians, and you don’t need any specialized knowledge in computer proof
assistants, AI or number theory to follow it.
