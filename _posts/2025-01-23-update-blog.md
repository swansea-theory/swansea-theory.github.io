![Hideki Tsuiki in Swansea](/assets/images/pro-sgPnZdmh.jpeg)

Professor Hideki Tsuiki from Kyoto University is visiting Swansea University from 22nd to 24th of January. Yesterday, he gave a talk on *Coinductive View of Shadows of 3D Fractals*.

  

The talk did not only give insight into a fascinating area of research, but was also entertaining. You may want to check out some of Prof. Tsuiki's videos, e.g. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsFD37f-2ck>
