**Title:** On information theory in geometric measure theory

**Abstract**

Effective and resource-bounded dimensions were defined by Lutz in 2003 and have proven to be useful and meaningful for quantitative analysis in the contexts of algorithmic randomness, computational complexity and fractal geometry.

  

The point-to-set principle (PSP) of J. Lutz and N. Lutz (2018) fully characterizes Hausdorff and packing dimensions in terms of effective dimensions in the Euclidean space, enabling effective dimensions to be used to answer open questions about fractal geometry, with already an interesting list of geometric measure theory results.

  

In this talk I will review the point-to-set principles focusing on recent applications and extensions and presenting open questions as well as further application opportunities.
