date: 2025-12-11

The speaker for this week's seminar is our own Troy. Please find the abstract below.

In this talk, I continue to develop my research programme Illustrative Devices of Computing which investigates the historical roots, and educational impacts, of the explanatory and discursive tools used in computing communication. After a brief motivation and review of approaches to the analysis of non-literality, I show my first attempts towards building a taxonomy of IDs using my previous work on the history of programming language semantics for the source. This talk will be a rehearsal for a presentation at the History and Philosophy of Computing conference and, as such, feedback is particularly welcomed.
