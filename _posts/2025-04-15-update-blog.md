| BCTCS 2025 at Strathclyde University, Glasgow |

Marek Jezinski, Alec Critten, Harry Bryant and Olga Petrovska are currently attending the 41st British Colloquium for Theoretical Computer Science at Strathclyde University, Glasgow.

  

Marek gave a talk on "Creating Synthetic Test Data for Rail Design Tools", Alec gave a talk on "Developing user propagators for graph-based SMT reasoning", and Harry gave a talk on "Proof Checking for SMT-solving and its application in the Railway Domain."

  

Olga, who is also BCTCS' Treasurer, will contribute to the education session with her talk on "The Art of Teaching Theory Across Diverse Backgrounds."
