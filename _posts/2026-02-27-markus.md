Title: An Empirical Study on Generating Proven-to-be-Correct Dafny Programs

Abstract: 

Generative AI (GenAI) for software production is, if not already in use, at least
considered to be a viable option. This poses the question: can GenAI reliably
produce software that meets requirements? We sharpen this question and ask
further: can GenAI reliably produce software together with ‘proof instructions’
that, together, allow for a fully automated correctness proof?

To investigate this question, we are presenting an empirical study
using the Dafny specification, programming, and verification framework. In
Dafny, methods can be specified using a contract. Dafny methods are
implemented using imperative programming. Dafny offers automatic verification,
which can be supported by code annotations, e.g., in the form of loop invariants. 
Using textbook programming exercises, we systematically experiment with
GenAI to establish if it can produce software that Dafny can automatically verify. 

This is a test talk for a workshop presentation. The research presented has been conducted by Liam O’Reilly [0000-0002-4894-2158], Filippos Pantekis [0000-0001-7817-6450], Alma Rahat [0000-0002-5023-1371], Markus Roggenbach [0000-0002-3819-2787], and Mukesh Tiwari [0000-0001-5373-9659]
