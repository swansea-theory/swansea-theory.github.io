In this weeks Theory Seminar, [Emmanuel](https://www.lacl.fr/emmanuel.rauzy/), from the Université de
Cétreil, will present his work on 'Residual properties of groups in
the continuous Weihrauch lattice.

For every class C of groups, one can define a sort of projection onto
C: indeed, every group has a greatest residually C quotient, where a
group is residually C if every non-identity element in this group has
a non-identity image via a morphism to a group in C.

I study how discontinuous this projection map is, in terms of
continuous Weihrauch reducibility over the topology of the space of
marked groups. This provides a useful complement to the Borel
Classification of C: indeed, the complexity of studying homomorphisms
towards groups of C is much better captured by this classification
than by the usual Borel classification of C.

I will introduce the main notions that are relevant in this context:
quasi-varieties, equational noetherianity, INIP groups.
