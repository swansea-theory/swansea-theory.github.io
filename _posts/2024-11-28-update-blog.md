Next week's theory seminar will be given by [Matteo Acclavio](https://profiles.sussex.ac.uk/p623544-matteo-acclavio) from the University of Sussex, who is visiting us for a few days. The topic will be a new logical framework for concurrent programs, abstract below.**Title:** A new logical framework for concurrent programs  
**Abstract:**  
Designing logical frameworks to reason about the properties of concurrent programs while accurately capturing the essence of concurrency is a challenging task.  
The main difficulties can be traced back to the syntactic constraints of the languages used for this purpose.

In this talk, I will present my ongoing line of research, which aims to provide a new computation-as-deduction paradigm for the study of concurrent programs.  
In particular, I will show you a non-commutative logic where we can interpret proofs as computation trees for the pi-calculus, and use proof nets to provide canonical representations of these trees modulo interleaving concurrency.  
  
This work is based on joint works with Giulia Manara and Fabrizio Montesi
