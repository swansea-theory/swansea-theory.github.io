CCC 2025 was an exceptional gathering that perfectly balanced intellectual stimulation with natural beauty. The conference delivered a series of captivating talks that challenged and inspired attendees, while the excursion to Gower provided a refreshing counterpoint to the intense academic discussions.



Big thanks to our invited speakers, contributors and other participants. See you in Kyoto next year!
