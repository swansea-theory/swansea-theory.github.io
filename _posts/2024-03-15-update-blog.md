The meeting aims to bring together people not only developing but also using Agda or even those who are simply interested in it. We will have talks on the implementation details of Agda in the morning and code sprints in the afternoon. You can still submit your proposal for a talk or discussion!

  

There's a (soft) deadline for registration on 14 April 2024.
